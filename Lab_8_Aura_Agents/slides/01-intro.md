# Lab 8: Aura Agents

## From Graph to Conversation

In previous labs, you built an Aircraft Digital Twin knowledge graph. Now you'll make it **conversational**.

## What You'll Build

An AI-powered agent that helps users explore the Aircraft Digital Twin by combining:
- **Graph traversal** - Follow relationships across aircraft topology
- **Natural language** - No Cypher required
- **Automatic tool selection** - The agent picks the right approach

## No Code Required

Aura Agents let you build intelligent interfaces through a visual UI - configure, test, and deploy without writing code.
