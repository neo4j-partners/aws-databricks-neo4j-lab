# Lab 8: Aura Agents

## From Graph to Conversation

The `populate-aircraft-db` tool built an Aircraft Digital Twin knowledge graph with operational data **and** enrichment data from maintenance manuals. Now you'll make it **conversational**.

## What You'll Build

An AI-powered agent that helps users explore the Aircraft Digital Twin by combining:
- **Cypher Templates** - Precise, controlled queries for aircraft overviews, sensor limits, and shared faults
- **Text2Cypher** - Natural language to Cypher for ad-hoc questions
- **Similarity Search** - Semantic retrieval over maintenance manual chunks

## No Code Required

Aura Agents let you build intelligent interfaces through a visual UI — configure, test, and deploy without writing code.
