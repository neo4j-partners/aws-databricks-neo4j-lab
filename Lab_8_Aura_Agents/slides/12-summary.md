# Summary

## What You Built

A no-code Aura Agent combining retrieval patterns:

| Pattern | Tool | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| Structured queries | Cypher Templates | Aircraft overviews, shared faults |
| Flexible queries | Text2Cypher | Ad-hoc questions about the graph |

## Key Takeaways

- **Aura Agents** require no code to build
- **Tool descriptions** guide automatic selection
- **Multiple patterns** combine for comprehensive answers
- **Agent reasoning** shows how decisions are made

## Workshop Complete!

You've built AI agents across three platforms:
- **AgentCore** (Lab 4) - Pre-deployed multi-agent orchestrator
- **AgentBricks** (Lab 7) - Multi-agent supervisor with Genie + Neo4j MCP
- **Aura Agents** (Lab 8) - No-code conversational interface
