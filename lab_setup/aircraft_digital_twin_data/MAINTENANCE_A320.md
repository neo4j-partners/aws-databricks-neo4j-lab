```

#### 2.1.1 Engine Systems (V2500-A1)

The A320-200 is powered by two International Aero Engines (IAE) V2500-A1 high-bypass turbofan engines, mounted in underwing nacelles. Each engine produces 25,000 lbf of thrust and operates independently with full redundancy. The V2500 features a two-spool design with a single-stage fan, 4-stage low-pressure compressor, 10-stage high-pressure compressor, annular combustor, 2-stage high-pressure turbine, and 5-stage low-pressure turbine. Engine health is continuously monitored via four dedicated sensors per engine measuring exhaust gas temperature (EGT), vibration levels, fan speed (N1), and fuel flow rate. The engine systems account for approximately 58% of all maintenance events in the fleet, with the most common issues being overheat conditions, vibration exceedances, and bearing wear.

**ATA Reference:** Chapters 71 (Powerplant), 72 (Engine), 73 (Engine Fuel and Control), 77 (Engine Indicating)

#### 2.1.2 Avionics System

The avionics system provides flight management, navigation, and air data computation functions essential for safe aircraft operation. The system is built around dual Flight Management Systems (FMS) that handle flight planning, navigation computation, performance optimization, and guidance commands. Three Air Data Computers (ADC) provide redundant altitude, airspeed, and Mach number calculations using pitot-static inputs. The Navigation Receiver integrates VOR, ILS localizer, glideslope, and marker beacon reception for precision approaches. All avionics components communicate via ARINC 429 digital data buses with built-in test equipment (BITE) for fault detection. Avionics-related maintenance events comprise approximately 22% of fleet issues, primarily involving sensor drift and electrical faults that are often resolved through software patches or calibration adjustments.

**ATA Reference:** Chapter 34 (Navigation)

#### 2.1.3 Hydraulics System

The A320-200 hydraulic system provides power for flight control surfaces, landing gear operation, brakes, thrust reversers, and cargo doors. The aircraft employs three independent hydraulic systems designated Green, Blue, and Yellow, each operating at 3,000 psi. This manual focuses on the Green system, which is powered by an engine-driven pump on Engine #1. The system includes a main hydraulic pump capable of 26 gpm flow rate, a 14.5-liter reservoir with integrated quantity indication, and multiple actuators including the flap actuator assembly for high-lift device operation. Hydraulic fluid (Skydrol LD-4) requires regular monitoring for contamination and proper fluid levels. The hydraulics system represents approximately 19% of maintenance events, with leaks and fluid contamination being the most common issues requiring attention.

**ATA Reference:** Chapter 29 (Hydraulic Power)

### 2.2 Engine Health Monitoring

| VIB | Engine Vibration | ips (inches/sec) | Fan case |
| N1Speed | Fan Speed | % RPM | Fan shaft |
| FuelFlow | Fuel Flow | kg/s | Fuel metering unit |

**Sensor Sampling Rate:** Continuous (1 Hz during flight, recorded hourly for trend analysis)
