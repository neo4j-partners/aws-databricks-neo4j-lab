    └── Flap Actuator Assembly
```

#### 2.1.1 Engine Systems (CFM56-7B)

The B737-800 is powered by two CFM International CFM56-7B high-bypass turbofan engines, mounted in close-coupled underwing nacelles with distinctive flat-bottomed nacelle design characteristic of the 737NG series. Each engine produces 26,300 lbf of thrust at takeoff and operates independently with full redundancy. The CFM56-7B features a single-spool low-pressure system and single-spool high-pressure system, with a 3-stage low-pressure compressor driven by a 4-stage low-pressure turbine, and a 9-stage high-pressure compressor driven by a single-stage high-pressure turbine. The engine incorporates a dual annular combustor (DAC) option for reduced emissions. Engine health is continuously monitored via four dedicated sensors per engine measuring exhaust gas temperature (EGT), vibration levels, fan speed (N1), and fuel flow rate. The engine systems account for approximately 70% of all maintenance events in the fleet, with the most common issues being sensor drift, contamination, and bearing wear.

**ATA Reference:** Chapters 71 (Powerplant), 72 (Engine), 73 (Engine Fuel and Control), 77 (Engine Indicating), 79 (Oil)

#### 2.1.2 Avionics System

The avionics system provides flight management, navigation, and air data computation functions essential for safe aircraft operation. The B737-800 features the Honeywell FMC with dual Flight Management Computers providing flight planning, 4D navigation, performance calculations, and VNAV/LNAV guidance. Three Air Data Computers (ADC) supply redundant altitude, airspeed, and Mach calculations via pitot-static inputs integrated with the Digital Flight Control System (DFCS). The multi-mode Navigation Receiver provides VOR/DME, ILS (localizer, glideslope, marker beacon), and GPS position data. All avionics communicate via ARINC 429 and ARINC 629 digital data buses with comprehensive Built-In Test Equipment (BITE). Avionics-related maintenance events comprise approximately 9% of fleet issues, primarily involving sensor drift that is typically resolved through calibration or software updates.

**ATA Reference:** Chapter 34 (Navigation)

#### 2.1.3 Hydraulics System

The B737-800 hydraulic system provides power for flight control surfaces, leading edge devices, trailing edge flaps, landing gear, wheel brakes, thrust reversers, and nose wheel steering. The aircraft employs two primary hydraulic systems designated System A and System B, each operating at 3,000 psi, plus a standby system for emergency backup. This manual focuses on System A, which is powered by two engine-driven pumps (one per engine) and one AC motor pump. The system includes main hydraulic pumps capable of 28 gpm flow rate at 3,000 psi, a reservoir with 5.5 gallon usable capacity, and multiple actuators including the flap actuator assemblies (inboard and outboard). Hydraulic fluid (MIL-PRF-83282 or Skydrol 5) requires regular monitoring for contamination and proper fluid levels. The hydraulics system represents approximately 21% of maintenance events, with leaks and contamination being the primary concerns.

**ATA Reference:** Chapter 29 (Hydraulic Power)

### 2.2 Engine Health Monitoring

Each CFM56-7B engine is equipped with four primary monitoring sensors:

| Sensor Type | Parameter | Unit | Location |
|-------------|-----------|------|----------|

| VIB | Engine Vibration | ips (inches/sec) | Fan frame, turbine frame |
| N1Speed | Fan Speed | % RPM | Fan shaft |
| FuelFlow | Fuel Flow | kg/s | Fuel metering valve |

**Sensor Sampling Rate:** Continuous (1 Hz during flight, recorded hourly for trend analysis)

**FADEC Integration:** The CFM56-7B features Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) which provides automatic engine parameter management, thrust setting, and fault detection/isolation.
