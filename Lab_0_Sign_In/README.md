# Lab 0 - Sign In
At the start of this lab, you should have received an information sheet. To begin, visit https://events.oneblink.ai and input the email you used to register for the lab, along with the event code (a 7-digit number) from the information sheet. Check the box to agree to the Terms and Conditions, and then click on Register.

Check your mailbox to get the OneBlink validation code, then copy the code.

Enter your email, the event code from the information sheet, and the validation code from your email, then click on the "Verify Code" button.

Once the entered information is validated, you will receive your own AWS and Neo4j accounts. Please refrain from sharing this account information with fellow attendees, as it is specifically assigned to you. Remember to save this information, as you will need it until the end of the lab. These accounts will be terminated by the end of the day.

## Sign into AWS
Once signed into OneBlink, you will see a link to the AWS sign-in console. Follow that link and the account number should be auto-populated.

We're now authenticated and logged into the AWS console.

At this point you can click through to dismiss any help dialogs. In the next lab we'll set up Neo4j Aura and load the knowledge graph.

## Next Steps

Continue to [Lab 1 - Aura Setup](../Lab_1_Aura_Setup) to create your Neo4j Aura database and load the knowledge graph.
