# Summary

## What You Accomplished

- Set up a **Neo4j Aura** database on AWS
- Restored a pre-built **knowledge graph** from backup
- Explored the graph using **Neo4j Explore**
- Saved credentials for later labs

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Graph Database** | Data model optimized for relationships |
| **Neo4j Aura** | Fully managed cloud graph service |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Entities + relationships extracted from documents |
| **Vector Index** | Enables semantic search on embeddings |

## Don't Forget!

Save your Neo4j credentials for later labs:
- **URI** (e.g., `neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`)
- **Username** (typically `neo4j`)
- **Password**

You'll enter these directly in each notebook's Configuration cell.
